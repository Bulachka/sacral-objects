## Assumptions
The project is dedicated to the Belarusian sacral stones, that play an important role in the traditional culture. 

Each stone has its name, type according to its sacral purpose, legend and placement. It could be connected 
with books and videos, where it is mentioned, and through them - with their authors.

## Requirements 
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt

## Usage
There is the list of the stones with short description, tags and number of comments on the main page.

Navigation made by a sidebar with the list of types, the page with bibliography and videos.

Only authenticated users could add objects to the site, every comment should be approved in the admin.

## Plans for future:
1. Redesign the site.
2. Make a localisation.
3. Connect all the stones with the google maps.
4. Fill the base!
